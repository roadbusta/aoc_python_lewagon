""" Part 1 Pseudocode:
1. Categorise a five letter string into a hand type based on the following logic:
- All numbers are the same
- 4 numbers are the same
- 3 numbers and two numbers are the same
- 3 numbers are the same
- 2 numbers and 2 numbers are the same 
- 2 numbers are the samep
- no numbers are tbe same
- 
2. Find some way of accounting for each of the hand ranks. Maybe a weighting factor?
2. Assign values to each of the strings where A = 14 and 2 = 2
3. Apply weighting factor based on type of hand and calculate score
